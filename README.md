## 💡 Motivation

Traditional graduation check-in processes are error-prone and stressful:
- Students receive paper QR codes that are easily lost or damaged.
- Graduation gowns have no pockets.
- Manual scanning slows down the ceremony and causes confusion.

**FacePass** solves these issues with real-time face recognition technology—streamlining student identification across photo stations and stage displays.

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition, NumPy, OS  
- **Face Detection:** HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)  
- **Embedding:** 128D face vector from dlib pretrained model  
- **Deployment:** Real-time camera input & edge processing

## 🔁 System Workflow

1. **Student Check-in:**  
   Photo is captured and stored in the student database.

2. **Photo Station / Stage Entry:**  
   Camera captures live image or video feed.

3. **Recognition:**  
   System compares faces to database using 128D embeddings.

4. **Display:**  
   Student name and info appear on screen or Jumbotron if match confidence > threshold.
